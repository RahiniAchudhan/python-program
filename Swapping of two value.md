# AIM:
   To write a python program for swapping of two alues

# ALGORITHM:

## Step 1:
  Get the two alues from the user


## Step 2:
  Assign the value of second variable to a temporary variable

## Step 3:
  Assign the value of the first variable to the second variable

## Step 4:
  Assign the value in temporary variable to the first variable

## Step 5:
  Print both the vaues it would be interchanged

## Step 6:
  End the program


# PROGRAM:

```
x = eval(input())
y = eval(input())
temp = x
x = y
y = temp
print("Swapping vvalues are:",x,y)
```

# OUTPUT:
