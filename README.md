# Swapping of Two Values
# AIM:
 To write a python program for swapping of two values

# ALGORITHM:

## Step 1:
  Get the two values from the user

## Step 2:
  Assign the value of the first variable to a temporary variable

## Step 3:
  Assign the value of the first variable to the second variable.

## Step 4:
  Assign the value in temporary variable to the first variable

## Step 5:
  Print both the values it would be interchanged

## Step 6:
  End the program

## PROGRAM:

```
x = eval(input())
y = eval(input())
temp = x
x = y
y = temp
print("Swapped values are:",x,y)

```
# OUTPUT:



# RESULT:

  Thus the swapping of two values are successfully executed
